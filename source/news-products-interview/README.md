# NYT News Products Code Test

## Email to the candidate

Thanks for taking the time to have a phone screen with us. Before bringing you in for an in-person interview, we would like you to take some time to do a tech screening that we can discuss at our in-person interview if all goes well.

Please find the link below which contains some scaffolding to get you started. If you have node installed, it should be as simple as just doing npm install to get our version of the "hello world" page up. You can use any libraries of your choice to render the content, but we've started you off with a frontend react implementation. You can ignore our custom fonts and substitute with one of your liking.

On the server side, we would like you to consume our Top Stories API (link below) and render 5 stories from the home section as close as possible to the design included (found in the mockups directory). You only need to concern yourself with the mobile breakpoint.

Next, use the Most Popular API (link below) to render 5 of the most viewed stories below the server side content after the document load is complete. Use the same design as Top Stories. Update this Readme with any pertinent information about running the application.

We expect it should take you 6 to 8 hours to complete. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. You can zip up your code and email us your result; please don't post your implementation online.

Thanks and good luck!

## Requirements

2. Server side render content coming from the Top Stories API
3. Client side render content from the Most Popular API
4. Match to designs as close as possible.
5. Zip up final work and send back.
