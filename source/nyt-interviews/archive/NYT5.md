Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to have a phone screen with us. Before bringing you in for an in-person interview, we would like you to take some time to do a tech screening that we can then discuss in our in-person interview if all goes well.

Attached is some scaffolding to get you started. If you have node installed, it should be as simple as just doing npm install to get our version of the "hello world" page up. On the server side, we would like you to consume our homepage JSON feed and render the design included (server-side.png). You can use any libraries of your choice to render the content on the front end and can ignore the custom fonts and substitute with one of your liking.

In addition, consume our fashion section front asynchronously and render the design included (client-side.png) below the output you generated above.
You can zip up your code and email us your result within one week; please don't post your implementation online.

JSON:
- Homepage feed: http://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/index.json
- Fashion feed: http://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp

Thanks and good luck!
