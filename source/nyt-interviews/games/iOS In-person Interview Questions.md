# iOS In-Person Interview Questions
This file contains questions that are open-ended and worthy of solving on a whiteboard.  The focus is on the candidate's problem solving skills.

- **Archive Screen** - The Crossword app uses cloud syncing to save games. The Archive screen needs to show local and remote progress. How might a high-level architecture look for that scenario? After this initial question, introduce more complex questions such as how to implement extended offline play, or solving a lot then logging in.
- **Solving Screen** - When solving, we want the app to save progress locally and, if the user is logged in, cloud sync. How, when and what could we save or sync during a user's solve? After this initial question, introduce more complex questions such as how to implement offline play, syncing merge conflicts, or accurately keeping timer time.
