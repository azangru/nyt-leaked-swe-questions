# NYTimes Android Code Challenge

For the next phase of your interview process, we would like to see some of your Android coding and testing skillsâ€¦ Some technologies that we use at the NYTimes are RxJava and Dagger 2, so demonstrating the use of these or similar SDKs would be a plus, but most importantly we want to see your overall style and approach to building and testing an application.  At your interview we will also discuss some of the approaches and decisions and thought processes that were considered within your application..

To submit your code, we are offering 2 different options..

### Option 1 - Build an app:

We'd like for you to build an Android application which allows a user to enter an organization name and then displays the top 3 most popular (by stars)  repository on GitHub for that organization.   A user should be able to click on one of the Repos and navigate to it within a webview or chrome custom tabs.
You can find details on the API here: https://developer.github.com/v3/  
Once you've completed the test, just submit via a GitHub link, or zip it up and share it (via Google Drive).  Please include instructions to build and test.

### Option 2 - Show an app:

You may have already built an open-source, or other application on your own.  You can submit this for us to review if you feel it is a good demonstration of your skills and experience.  
You can submit this via a GitHub link, or zip it up and share it (via Google Drive).  Please include instructions to build and test.  

The amount of time spent to complete this exercise will not affect our evaluation. We understand that you are likely to have many things, both personally and professionally, that may slow you down. Good luck!
