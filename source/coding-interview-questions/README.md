# Subscription Platforms Group - NYTimes Coding Interview Question Bank

This repository acts as a coding interview question bank for Subscriptions Platforms Group (SPG) to contribute to and use for interviewing candidates.

### Structure

The questions are organized by _language_. There is a readme in each folder with more instructions.

# Contributing to the Question Bank

Everyone is encouraged to contribute their coding questions (take-home, practicals, in-person coding exercises, etc.) to this repo. You are also welcome to submit PRs to fix or add to other team's questions.

Please submit a PR of your coding question and have it approved & merged by at least 1 other person to get it into `master`.
