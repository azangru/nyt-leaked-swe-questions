# Lead and Principal Engineer Hiring Process

_Hiring a candidate at the Lead or Principal Engineer level requires the approval of the PEL in the reporting line and a memo written by the hiring manager that outlines how the candidate meets behavior and work expectations for the level. The hiring manager may also want to make changes to the tech screen and interview panel steps as discussed later in this document._

It is up to the hiring manager to recommend that a candidate be considered at the Lead or Principal Engineer level. In practice, leveling the candidate as a potential Lead or Principal Engineer could happen at any time in the process. But in most cases, an indication of a candidate's level will come from either the initial recruiter phone screen or technical assessment. The hiring manager can decide to hire a candidate at a less senior level if the PEL does not approve the hiring manager’s original leveling recommendation.

## The Memo
1. The hiring manager writes a memo outlining how the candidate meets behavior and work expectations for the Lead or Principal Engineer level. The memo should be started as early as possible and used as a working document throughout to keep a candidate moving swiftly through the interview process. The hiring manager shares the memo with the PELS member and other managers in the reporting line, who may collaborate on it. The memo should highlight how the candidate has the skills to operate at the Lead or Principal Engineer level. Use the [Product Engineering Hiring Memo Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0LtJp8oTbL2rMxROYKYGfKlKgmKVVBrib036_ZDlU8/edit) as a template for this memo.
 
2. While writing the memo, the hiring manager should review and include feedback from people familiar with the candidate’s work, such as members of the interview panel and references the candidate provides. To gather feedback from individual interviewers, the usual "Tech Hiring - In-person Interview Assessment" form should be used. The recruiter will share the aggregated feedback with the hiring manager. The hiring manager should seek feedback from a diverse group of people (e.g., from multiple levels, disciplines, and backgrounds). All feedback is added to the memo. Feedback should be attributed to the person who provided it.

3. To ensure fairness and consistency across the department, the PEL convenes a meeting of representative managers, Lead and Principal engineers in their mission to discuss the candidate and updates the memo as necessary. This meeting is recommended but not required, and it is up to the PEL on which people to include. This meeting can also include the recruiter. To keep the hiring process for a candidate efficient and fast-moving, this meeting can be part of the debrief step since many of these people may have been part of the interview panel. When the PEL conducts this meeting, they should set expectations for how they would like participants to review the memo and contribute feedback. If there is an ongoing need for Lead and Principal engineers in a mission, the PEL and hiring managers may want to document and share context around that need proactively.
   
4. As a final step to encourage transparency and calibration across Product Engineering, the PEL in the reporting line shares the memo with other members of PELS. They are also invited to give feedback. The expectation is that the hiring process for a candidate can move ahead without waiting for this feedback from PELS.
   
5. The PEL in the reporting line makes the final decision on whether to hire the candidate. If approved, the hiring manager works with their recruiter to send a proposed compensation offer to Talent & Inclusion.
   
6. Members of PELS will meet periodically to discuss hiring decisions to encourage consistency in future Lead and Principal Engineer hiring across Product Engineering.

Note that the same process also holds true for people transferring from another career track.

## Other modifications specific to this hiring process
Hiring managers should own the building of interview panels that they believe will result in hiring exceptional candidates that will improve the quality and diversity of the team. As with earlier versions of this hiring process, including Principal Engineers on an interview panel is an option, but so is adding other team members or partners.

It is optional to include the PEL in the reporting line as part of the interview panel. However, in most instances, hiring managers should expect the PEL to be part of the interview process to assess a Lead or Principal Engineer candidate and pitch them on the role and the team.

When a potential Lead or Principal Engineer level candidate is identified after the Tech Screen step, the Panel Interview can be modified to include additional technical assessments, such as one similar to the Tech Screen System Architecture topic below.

### Changes to the Tech Screen
1. Use the [technical assessment question from the Tech Hiring guide](https://hiring.tech.nyt.net/guides-and-questions/tech-screen/coding-overview/). Currently, this is “Remove Dupes.”

2. **System Architecture** - Facilitate a deep dive by the candidate into a system they've designed, built, and ran. Ask them to whiteboard the system and probe them on overall design, tech stack, scaling challenges, trade-offs, bugs, monitoring, etc. The [Manager Hiring doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StGa2cWOnt0LDlJYDOFMW-acE9X4SqIraqODS0AcQW8/edit#heading=h.up37ncj5lwso) has additional prompts for this exact question.

    Also, probe on the following:  
        - What aspects of the system was the candidate responsible and accountable for?  
        - Team/staffing: what was the makeup of the team? What were the levels of people on the team? How much mentoring/coaching did they do as part of leading the building of the system? How did they explain technical concepts to engineers at different levels?  
        - How did the system evolve over time? What adjustments/improvements did they make? Would they do anything differently if they had to do it again?  
        - How did they operate the system in production? Did they run into any production issues? What was the process for dealing with outages? How did they monitor the system?  
        - What were the technical and business success metrics for the system?  
    
### Changes to the Panel Interview
_The Algorithms & Data Structures and System Design sessions are extended to 90 minutes to allow for more in-depth discussion. The Algorithms & Data Structures session should be specific to the domain of the hiring team. A session on Leadership & Strategy is added._
 
1. **System Design** - Have the candidate design a system from the ground up based on requirements presented to them. Pick one from this [guide](https://hiring.tech.nyt.net/guides-and-questions/onsite/systems-design/systems-design-interview/).

2. **Domain-Specific Algorithms & Data Structures** - This session is an architectural deep dive on the particular area of expertise the team is looking to hire for:
   
    Ask the candidate to answer the question: “Imagine you have to build a system from scratch.” Ask them to whiteboard their system. The system should be domain-specific to the team, e.g., a recommendation system for the Machine Learning Engineering team.  
   
    Look for:  
        - What kinds of monitoring or alerting should be added to this system?  
        - What are the system-level and goal-related metrics you'd use?  
        - What data do we need to do this properly?  
        - What kind of experiments do we need to run to test our system?  
    
3. **Ability to Learn & Teach** - Same as the standard hiring process.

4. **Values Alignment** - Same as the standard hiring process.

5. **Leadership & Strategy** - Questions should be taken from the [PELS: Leadership / strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StGa2cWOnt0LDlJYDOFMW-acE9X4SqIraqODS0AcQW8/edit#heading=h.t28n1rft4xbe) question bank.

6. **Hiring Manager** - Same as the standard hiring process.
