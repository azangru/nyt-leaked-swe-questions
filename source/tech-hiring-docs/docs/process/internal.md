 

Transferring between projects and departments is an excellent way for employees to grow within the Times. It enables people to take on new challenges, learn new skills and gain a more complete understanding of the organization. It is our policy that such internal transfers should be encouraged.

That said, all parties involved in a transfer — the person requesting it, their current manager and the manager of the team they want to transfer to — share a common-sense responsibility to ensure critical work is not interrupted and this policy is not abused.

This document is an effort to provide guidance, based on the internal transfer requirements laid out in the [Digital Hiring Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgY97l_b2xgav775v4WBFNq08BI5cMyj2du1O3hHI4o/edit#).

## The application process
Transparency and empathy are the hallmarks of a successful transfer. Employees should never fear being punished for pursuing an internal opportunity, and managers should not have to worry about being surprised by a transfer that has already been negotiated or agreed to.

### Transfer candidates

- A transfer often begins with informal conversations between the transfer candidate and their prospective new team. You are under no obligation to report these conversations to your manager and can do so at your own discretion.

- If, after those informal conversations, you resolve to formally pursue a transfer, you must notify your manager. If you are uncomfortable having this conversation with your manager, feel free to reach out to someone else in your reporting chain or Katie Honadle, Business Partner in Talent and Inclusion.

- You should generally look to remain in your job for at least a year before requesting another transfer.

### Current managers

- Use regular and quarterly check-ins to stay attuned to the ambitions of your direct reports. Ideally you should know ahead of time if your employee wants to transfer. You might even suggest a transfer in the course of career development conversations.

- Discuss the transfer with the candidate once you are made aware of it. You should be supportive. Issues like team workload, concerns about replacing the position, or your personal feelings about the move are not valid reasons to impede the transfer.

- If you have specific concerns about the transfer or its timing, discuss them with the employee. If you cannot reach a resolution, escalate the conversation to your manager or someone else higher up in your reporting chain.

- At some point before the interview process, you should have a conversation with the prospective hiring manager. Serve as a reference for your employee, and be honest.

### Hiring managers

- Set a meeting to answer the candidate’s questions about the job. Consider suggesting other members of your team the candidate can speak with candidly about things like day-to-day responsibilities and team dynamics.

- Reach out to the candidate’s current manager for feedback and guidance — but only after you have confirmed the candidate has spoken with them first.

- You are responsible for communicating clear expectations about the interview and evaluation process to the candidate.

- Make sure you have enough budget on your open position to transfer the candidate. An internal transfer is not different than hiring an external candidate. You need to be able to afford the person.

## The interview process
There is no guarantee that a transfer request will be approved. The transfer candidate is still expected to demonstrate the skills and sensibilities required of their desired position, and the hiring manager is ultimately responsible for hiring the candidates who are best for their team.

### Transfer candidates

- Expect to be evaluated with rigor and fairness, just as you would if you were applying for the job from outside the company. Although it undoubtedly helps your case, your tenure at the company does not guarantee you will he hired for an internal position.


### Hiring managers

- At minimum, you must discuss the transfer with the candidate, the candidate’s current manager and your team. You can impose additional interviews and evaluation at your discretion. All parties involved should have a chance to offer feedback.

- Special arrangements such as trial periods can be arranged between the candidate, his or her current manager and the hiring manager on a case-by-case basis. They are neither explicitly encouraged nor prohibited. The arrangement should account for what happens if the trial does not lead to a full-time offer.

- You are under no obligation to also consider external candidates for a position you want to fill with a transfer. Use your judgment and fill the position in accordance with your team’s needs and company values.
The offer process
Once it is approved, all parties involved have a responsibility to ensure an orderly transfer. That includes allowing reasonable time for a candidate to wrap up any remaining work and transfer knowledge to other members of the team.

- The process should be biased in favor of the transfer: The goal is to transition the candidate out of their current responsibilities as quickly as possible and to facilitate a clean break — a candidate should not have to carry responsibilities from their old job into their new one.

## The offer process

### Transfer candidates

- If you are offered a position after the interview process, you should accept or decline in a timely manner.

- If you accept, you should expect to finish any outstanding work, write documentation and train your colleagues. Work with your current manager to establish a reasonable transition plan with clear expectations.

- If you are unable to arrive at a reasonable transition plan with your current manager,  reach out to someone else in your reporting chain or Talent & Inclusion.

### Current managers

- Talk to the transfer candidate and their soon-to-be manager to set up a reasonable transition plan. You should aim to complete the transfer as quickly as possible, but it is your responsibility to ensure that all work is completed and knowledge is transferred to other members of the team. You have the final say on this timeline.

- You should work to ensure that the employee does not take old responsibilities with them when he or she transfers to a new team. Although some level of informal support might follow the employee in the short term, the goal should be to remove that from their plate as soon as possible.

- Email Stacey Olive (Recruiting), Marguerite Brown Toohey and Sue Kim (Finance) with details about how you plan to backfill the vacant position.

### Hiring managers

- Whether or not you choose to hire the transfer candidate, inform them in a timely manner. If you do not hire the candidate, you should also consider offering constructive feedback to explain how the candidate could improve their chances in the future.

- Email Stacey Olive (Recruiting), Marguerite Brown Toohey and Sue Kim (Finance), Katie Honadle (Talent & Inclusion Business Partner) and the leadership of all relevant teams to review and discuss transfer logistics. Also contact Karen Schmidt to coordinate moving transfers to their new floor/desk.

- Compensation and title changes are not guaranteed and should be handled on a case-by-case basis in consultation with Talent & Inclusion and Finance. These conversations should begin before the offer is formally extended.

- Talk with the candidate and their current manager to work out a reasonable timeline for the transfer. The current manager has the authority to set this timeline, with an understanding that the transfer should be completed as soon as possible.

## Transfers between the Manager and Technical Engineering Tracks

There’s no equivalency on the tracks, a Manager or Director transitioning to the Technical Track will keep their compensation (salary and bonus) but will hold the title of Sr Engineer. To become a Lead or Principal the employee will follow the evaluation process described in the career ladder. The same goes for going from the technical track to the management track.
