Candidates that meet the threshold score for the initial review move on to do a
phone screen with a recruiter. These conversations cover:

-   Getting aligned with the candidate about salary, job title and, most
    importantly, talking through open roles to narrow down which positions are a
    good fit or if the candidate has a preference for a particular open role. As
    backend teams use different technologies/languages, this narrowing should,
    in part, include discussing the candidate's knowledge of (or interest in
    learning) different technologies/languages.

-   Getting some more information that may not be in the application materials
    such as visa requirements or unexplained career gaps.

-   Light technical overview to make sure the candidate has practical experience
    with the technologies we're looking for.

See [Recruiter Phone Screen: What to Cover](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WyEkirQIQUz-ljmAb7rJry0i5PO3Ai2tOVjKtTo8d0w/edit).

This screening also provides an opportunity to catch any major red flags, such
as displaying a disrespectful or non-collaborative attitude.

After the Phone screen the recruiter also submits a crediting plan assessment,
along with any other information in Workday. The recruiter will email the
candidate to inform them either that they will not be moving forward or to walk
through next steps.
