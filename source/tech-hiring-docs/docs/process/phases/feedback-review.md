1. All interviewers gather to share their feedback about the candidate. Before 
   meeting, the interviewers are asked to fill out two feedback forms, one 
   single-question Workday form and one in-depth form from the hiring panel.

2. All interviewers, tech screen and in-person, will convene with the hiring
   managers for the match teams as well as a Panel Coordinator (recruiter) to
   discuss feedback.

3. Once the debrief has taken place and assessments have been submitted in
   Workday, the hiring managers for the match teams and the Panel Coordinator
   meet to review the feedback and determine whether any of the teams want to
   hire the candidate.

4. If multiple teams want to hire, we let the candidate choose.

5. We may want to pitch the candidate on a particular role or team, and set up a
   follow up conversation with hiring managers / team members if needed.
