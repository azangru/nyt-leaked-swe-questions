1. Candidates will receive an email and calendar invite from a recruiting 
   coordinator with an outline of the day, the people they will meet (including
   their roles and responsibilities), and what general topics the interviews 
   will cover.

2. The Panel Interview includes two technical interviews, three non-technical
   interviews and a catch up conversation with the recruiter (a break for lunch
   will be scheduled if the various sessions are clustered together)

3. Interviewers will receive an email and calendar invite from Recruiting that
   outlines panel participants and candidate information (name and resume).
   Links to relevant question banks and rubrics will be included. On the day of
   the interview, a separate email will be sent to panel participants with a
   link to provide feedback in our google form (as well as in Workday).

Overall we aim to:

-   Create a diversity of content and style for technical interviews

-   Give a match team the opportunity to focus on a particular skill

-   Give weight to non-technical segments, letting candidates and teams evaluate
    each other

Most interviews will be conducted by members of the match teams.
Some interviews may be conducted by members outside of the match teams,
depending on skill, role, and panel diversity requirements.

## Panel Interview Segments

The order of segments may change depending on candidate and interviewer
schedules, but by default a day of in-person interviews is comprised of:

|Session|Duration|Details|
|-------|--------|-------|
|Meet and Greet|15 minutes|The recruiter meets the candidate, offers tea/coffee/water, pointer to the restrooms, brief tour of the working space, orientation, introductions.|
|Algorithm design and coding|45 minutes|Process-specific guides are located in the [interview guides](/guides-and-questions/onsite/algo-and-data-structures/) section of these docs.|
|System design / Architecture|45 minutes|Process-specific guides are located in the [interview guides](/guides-and-questions/onsite/systems-design/) section of these docs.|
|Ability to learn and teach|30 minutes|Process-specific guides are located in the [interview guides](/guides-and-questions/onsite/non-technical/learn-and-teach/) section of these docs.|
|Values alignment|30 minutes|Process-specific guides are located in the [interview guides](/guides-and-questions/onsite/non-technical/values/) section of these docs.|
|Interview(s) with Hiring Managers from matched teams|30 minutes||

### Team Specific Segments

Teams may want to ask additional questions as part of panel interviews, or replace certain
technical questions with ones specifically relevant to the team. They should work with
their recruiter to draft up a question to be used consistently across all applicants to
the role.

### Lunch

One or more engineers from the match teams. Whoever takes the candidate to lunch 
should make it clear to the candidate that it is informal and they are not 
being evaluated. The time is meant as a break from interviews and  provide time 
for the candidate to ask questions. One of the interviewers should pay for the 
candidate and anyone else in the lunch group, then submit it as a "Recruiting" 
expense.
