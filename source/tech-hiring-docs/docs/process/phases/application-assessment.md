1. Candidates submit a resume and application questionnaire when they apply in Workday.
2. The recruiter will do a first pass to remove any clear disqualifications:
   applicants sometimes do not submit a resume, or we know we cannot sponsor
   certain kinds of visas.
3. The recruiter will work with managers to identify potential match teams for 
   the candidate.
4. Candidates are either declined in Workday or accelerated to a Recruiter Phone
   Screen followed by a Google Hangouts interview.

We want to keep the process open to candidates with limited experience (say,
right out of college or boot camp), but depending on the volume of applications,
we may need to prioritize Google Hangouts screens for some
candidates over others. This may be based on level (if the top priority openings
are for a particular level of seniority) or by adjusting the threshold crediting
plan score for acceptable candidates.
