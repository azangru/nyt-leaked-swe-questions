Recruiter to send out [take home assignment](/interview-questions/mobile/take-home-assignment) to candidates. There is no time limit but candidates are advised to communicate when they expect to be able to deliver the completed assignment.

After distributing the code assignment to the candidate, Austen will add their details to the internal tracking spreadsheet shared with the hiring managers.

# Assignment Code Review

Any code tests received are added to a Google Drive, along with a candidate's resume. This information is shared privately via a tracking spreadsheet with the hiring lead.

The hiring lead then distills the info into three data points:
    - date received
    - link to download the code test
    - years of professional experience the candidate has had with a mobile role
This information is transcribed into a [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kvik_4gN6sIUirXKs16sthyS9buQVJlWignCKNJV_NM/edit#gid=0) shared with all potential code test reviewers.

Mobile engineers have two-hour blocks twice a week reserved for any potential hiring-related activities (code reviews, hangouts, hiring process work). Within that time, if there are any new code assignments for review, they self-assign via the spreadsheet.

The code test is evaluated based on [this rubric](/interview-questions/mobile/code-review-rubric/) and the results are shared with the hiring lead.
