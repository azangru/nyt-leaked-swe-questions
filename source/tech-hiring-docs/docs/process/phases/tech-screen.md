## Google Hangouts Interview

1. One of the hiring managers and/or Sr Engineer on the panel conducts a Google
   Hangouts interview.

2. Recruiter informs the candidate that the interview will be 60 minutes and to
   be prepared for a paired programming exercise.

3. Prior to the Hangouts screen, the recruiter will ask what language the
   candidate would prefer to use for the programming exercise so that we can
   best match them with an interviewer, being clear will not affect which
   positions they can fill.

4. The Manager/Sr Engineer submits feedback to the general panel. If the
   manager’s recommendation is that the interviewee should move forward, the
   manager might also make recommendations on which open positions the candidate
   may be best suited for (i.e., the match teams).

5. The panel reviews the interviewer’s feedback and decides whether to move the
   candidate to the next phase.

6. The recruiter calls the candidate to either inform them that they will not be
   moving forward or to walk through next steps.

The Google Hangouts interview is meant to get a breadth of signals about a
candidate: We want to learn as much as we can with the least amount of
investment. Interviewers should aim to get a sense for whether the candidate can
succeed on the code test and in-person interviews and continue to narrow down
which open roles the candidate is best suited for.

As part of being on the hiring panel for candidate hangout interviews,
interviewers should list their proficiency in any languages. The recruiting team
will do its best to match candidates with an interviewer who knows their
preferred language. This is not a hard requirement, and ability to explain the
concepts of an esoteric/unfamiliar language are also an informative signal as
part of a phone screen (under the Communication part of the hangouts rubric).

## Mobile-only Assignment Review Hangout with Candidate

The two engineers who reviewed the code test share a Google Hangout with the 
candidate to answer questions raised during code review, discuss rationale for 
choices, brainstorm on different solutions that the candidate could have taken, 
etc.

The goals of the session are twofold:

  1. Answer any lingering questions about the candidate's technical ability.
  2. Gather signals about how the candidate would work with others on a 
     day-to-day basis. (How they communicate, how they handle feedback, 
     criticism, etc.)
