### Application Questionnaire

A strong cover letter can provide good context for a candidate’s application,
but they tend to be formulaic and not particularly useful to hiring panels,
which is wasted effort on everyone’s part.

When candidates apply in Workday they will be asked to fill out a short
questionnaire. This gives candidates an opportunity to add information that
doesn’t fit on a resume, perhaps to explain some life circumstances or career
gaps, as well as give more color to their candidacy. The questionnaire is meant
to be a light-lift effort for the candidate is not a barrier to entry.
Applications will still be considered without a questionnaire.

Initial questions:

-   How did you hear about our job posting?
-   In a few sentences, tell us why are you interested in working at The New
    York Times. There are no wrong answers, we just want to know what you care
    about.
-   What perspectives can you bring to the role that will make us better?
-   Is there anything else we should know about you?

Once the application is submitted, an automated email is sent from Workday
acknowledging the application. If the candidate does not move forward for a
recruiter Google Hangouts screen, an automated email is sent from Workday to let
the applicant know they will not move forward.

### Re-applying in Workday

After some period of time we would like declined candidate to be able to
re-apply, but currently Workday does not allow re-applying to the same
requisition. As a workaround, every 6 months we will close and re-open the
evergreen listing under a different requisition. The hiring panel will help
clean up candidate lists at the transition time by moving short-listed
applicants between the requisitions and make decisions about the ones in limbo.
