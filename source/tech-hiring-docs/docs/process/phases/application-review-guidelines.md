### Application Assessment

Candidates submit a resume and [application questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQGmJEVXvtI_ZeIOKLZKArK_22YgRRxMBqLMIsuPlNM/edit#heading=h.46aqz9xi05lr) when they apply in Workday. A recruiter does the first pass to remove any clear disqualifications, like applicants who do not submit a resume, or where we know we cannot sponsor certain visas.

Three hiring managers will review application materials and submit assessments for each candidate. The assessment consists of:  

  - Level (junior, mid, senior)  
  - Move forward to a recruiter phone screen?  
  - Justification

The level is loosely based on the [engineering career ladder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4DPQr5RmuzxS_sAYOKCHx0IyOXXJ5iQSY_6dx8Mlao/edit#heading=h.mi374da9esev) (to the extent that a level can be inferred from a resume) and is useful for filtering candidates based on the hiring panel’s throughput and open roles.

Whether to move the candidate forward and the justification for that decision should be based on the Application Review Rubric. At this stage in the process, candidates do not need to be scored on individual criteria, but the rubric provides a framework for decision-making. This helps us avoid bias by focusing feedback on specific criteria that have been decided upon and described ahead of time. We also reduce bias by having multiple people submit assessments.

For each week of the open application window, the managers and the recruiter on the hiring panel will meet to review the assessments and discuss whether candidates should move forward to a recruiter phone screen. If the reviewers all agree to move a candidate forward then there is no need for further discussion. In any other scenario, the panel should discuss their assessments and come to a decision. There should be a discussion even when all the panelists decline to move the candidate forward, just to acknowledge that their reasons are all valid.

### Reviewing Resumes

Before reviewing a candidate’s application, managers should familiarize themselves with the crediting plan below and these useful guides:

### Application Review Rubric

The rubric for application review was developed by defining the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) that we want candidates to possess, with a focus on being able to discern a signal for  each KSA from the candidate’s resume and questionnaire answers. 

|KSA|Superior|Good|Acceptable|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ability to clearly articulate a personal reason for wanting to work at NYT|Can speak to the evolution of our coverage and website/app technical abilities, as a reader.
