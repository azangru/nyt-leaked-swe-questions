# Hiring Process

**tl;dr**: A more general, high-level overview is available in the 
[Tech Hiring Process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15fejc-UdZXwIkMgn99JWYlBRJQLECtLBV-qJLdZOKVA/edit?usp=sharing)
slide deck.

## Goals of the process

Our goal is to successfully fill engineering positions by providing a standardized
process managers can use to hire the candidates they need. The unified hiring 
process provides a base framework with core, default assessments that managers
can build on for specialized roles. This core shared framework saves managers and recruiters time, while allowing us to focus on specializing what we need to for specific roles.
Recruiters will partner with hiring managers identify potential matches, as well as
work within the framework to evaluate candidates in a timely, fair, and consistent fashion.

The consolidated hiring process has been a huge help to our hiring velocity across
the organization. We have recognized that we don't need every manager to reinvent 
hiring, and that many of the competencies are shared across all our roles. In addition,
the logistical consistency of how hiring works has saved time for everyone involved in 
the process. We hope to keep this framework in place, including maintaining the 
consolidated generic role. We will, however, also encourage managers to be accountable
for hiring any specialized skills they need, and recruiters will work with them to
update the process where applicable for that specialty.

We also hope to make it easier for people to move between teams in the organization
and have more control over their careers. We want a new hire 
to not only feel comfortable on a team, but to feel cross-team moves and longer 
career paths are possible. And we want managers across the organization to believe 
to feel invested and supportive of the careers of their engineers.

### Who is included in a hiring panel?

A hiring panel will comprise:

-   Recruiter
    -   Reviews candidate applications
    -   Perform recruiter phone screen
-   Interested Engineering Managers
    -   Reviews candidate applications
    -   Will make final decisions on hiring for their respective teams
-   Software Engineers (inside and outside the relevant teams)
    -   Facilitate Google Hangout Technical Screen.
    -   Participate in panel interviews.
-   Other Contributors
    -   Participate in non-technical panel interviews. 

For non-team members participating in hiring, participation in hiring panels may require a commitment of up to \~10% of their time.

This process represents a shift in expectations for committing one’s time to the
hiring process: for many interviews, a candidate may not be interviewing for 
panelist's specific team, so an interview panelist may not directly benefit
from participating.

However, hiring high-quality, diverse candidates is in everyone’s best interest
and helps improve the company overall. Participating in hiring panels also has
the individual benefits of:

-   meeting other engineers and managers from across the tech organization
-   making a meaningful contribution to team culture
-   demonstrating good citizenship which is a strong positive factor in career
    development

### Hiring Panel Diversity

The [Digital Hiring Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgY97l_b2xgav775v4WBFNq08BI5cMyj2du1O3hHI4o/edit#heading=h.2iafu3kvkb1o) states that interview panels should aim to be diverse in experience and demographics, in order to

-   add different perspectives to both the hiring panel and hiring decisions,
-   demonstrate our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace, and
-   gain access to diverse abilities and insights that can fuel innovation.

Diversity is many things — gender, ethnicity, race, cultural background, sexual orientation, age — but at a minimum the panel should have:

-   at least one female engineer, per the [Diverse Interview Panel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EITxj5k2LJedC1PQQnfjqWPWZnUc3cDWrsB9W2of7VM/edit) guide
-   at least one each of:
    -   Lead/Senior Software Engineer
    -   Software Engineer
    -   Engineering Manager

The Times has also made a commitment to interview a diverse candidate pool for each and every open job. Before making any offers, teams are required to consider a diverse candidate pool. At this point in time, we are defining a diverse candidate pool as including at least two genders and two ethnicities.

### Matching Candidates and Teams

While a generalized process meets some of our hiring process objectives, we want
to acknowledge that teams have different ways or operating and may require
slightly different skill sets. In consultation with hiring managers and tech
leadership, the recruiting team will come up with teams with openings as potential matches
for the candidate. This may be based on:

-   Strategic priorities

    -   From high to low priority, open positions will be prioritized by whether
        a team:

        -   Has no engineers and needs to be staffed for a high-priority
            initiative.

        -   Is missing engineers that are necessary for high priority
            initiatives.

        -   Has lost a key skill set that presents a risk or blocker.

        -   Has a general backfill.

    -   It is up to the engineering and product managers to make a case to tech
        and product leadership, who will rank the list in coordination with HR.

-   Team diversity priorities
-   Candidate seniority
-   Candidate skill set and experience
-   Whether a hiring manager with an open role brought in the candidate

    -   In this case we still have another match team participate in in-person
        interviews, but any manager who sources a candidate directly will get a
        guaranteed slot on the interview an opportunity to make an offer.

-   As an option, Candidates will be offered to meet with teams in person or
    over hangouts to make themselves more familiarized with exact team they will
    be working on
