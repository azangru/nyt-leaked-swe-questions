This process owes a lot of credit to the hard work of so many who on the 
processes that came before:

- [Tech Sourcing Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvpmTIizaa2gT4n03meZGqPBqlMISAov3v2Finvt0TA/edit#)
- [News Experience hiring process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jWvNx2yi13-vqWJ7gW0KLOsICmbCoCCNosN7ng2hKPI/edit#)
and the [Interactive News hiring process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0KAbEauNFdY97X990kXCfqJ-aVAtdWrcSfdkaqA4sY/edit#)
and has been adapted for hiring based on an evergreen job posting covering more
teams. Special thanks to the Interactive News team for researching and laying
the groundwork for a bias-aware and measurable interview process.
