# Candidate's Guide to Internal Mobility

In Product Engineering, we believe that it’s important to offer our engineers opportunities to take on new roles or shift to a new context as part of long-term career growth.

We support and encourage you in considering several different types of internal mobility:

-   **Shifting to a new context in your current skillset.**  For example: if you are a frontend engineer, shifting to a frontend role in a different team or mission as a way to try a new context or expand your technical breadth.
-   **Shifting to a role with a different skillset.**  For example: a backend engineer transitioning to a native engineering role.
-   **Shifting from the individual contributor to management track.**
-   **Shifting from the management track to the individual contributor track.**

This guide covers Internal Mobility from a candidate’s perspective.  If you’re a manager, please also take time to review the [The Manager's Guide to Internal Mobility](/internal-mobility/manager-guide/)

## Some notes upfront

-   **These guidelines are for engineers within Product Engineering.**  Other parts of the organization handle internal mobility differently so consult with your Human Resources partner.
-   **Transfers are not automatic, but you should expect a fair evaluation.**  We’ll go into more detail later on, but it’s important to note that you will be one of potentially many internal and external candidates for the opening.
-   **Generally, we expect someone to be in their role for at least one year before looking to transfer.**  This is to ensure continuity and engagement in each assignment.  However, exceptions can be made if you have a particularly strong interest or skill alignment with an opening, or for other extenuating circumstances.  When in doubt, you should move forward with the process but be prepared to discuss a shorter tenure with the recruiter and hiring manager.
-   **You must be in good performance standing to change roles.** This means that you should not be on an active performance improvement plan, or in discussion about that being the next step.  If you have any questions or concerns about your performance standing, you should reach out to our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), or [Kate McCracken](mailto:kate.mccracken@nytimes.com) directly. 

*For engineers considering another individual contributor role:*

-   **Promotions are considered separately from transfers: all individual contributor moves are lateral, at the same title.**  If a move significantly increases a contributors’ scope, a promotion nomination can be submitted in the next cycle.
-   **Compensation generally remains lateral on transfers.**

*If you’re transitioning between management roles, or from an individual contributor role to a management role:*

-   **The title of the posted role should influence the level of candidate that the team is looking for, but the level is ultimately determined by the hiring manager and PELs.**
-   **Compensation is handled on a case-by-case basis.**

*If you’re transitioning from management into the engineering track:*

-   **The standard [Career Ladder evaluation processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yeJ76GAk0GeSKTI6heoF-LD87nVLbzWbJ_vD0uY05CE/edit) will be used** to set your level.  For example, if you’re moving from a management position and want to be considered for a Lead Engineer role the [Lead template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmFXvwOpXFZSj7LTBeAgzy53dowpCVnv--ojXUsviJA/edit) will need to be completed, and you will go through the interview process.
-   **Compensation is handled on a case-by-case basis.**

## The spirit of internal mobility

-   **Internal mobility brings strong benefits to both you and the company, and we expect all involved to be supportive.**  We expect all managers to be encouraging and supportive of their reports in pursuing internal opportunities. We expect all hiring managers to give thorough consideration to internal applicants.  We expect your support for peers that are transitioning into or out of your team.
-   **We encourage you to take a chance!**  While each position requires an interview and has posted qualifications, we encourage you to submit an application even if you meet some — but not all — of the requirements (levels, skills, etc.)  There is no downside to submitting an application. We hope that even applications that don’t result in a job change can serve as a learning opportunity. As you continue to seek internal opportunities, we’ll be sure that feedback from an interview is only shared as absolutely necessary.  
-   **You are not alone!**  HRBP and Talent Acquisiton teams are available to support you. If you need help navigating or have a question at any point in the process (considering opportunities, applying, interviewing, or during the offer or transition stage), don’t hesitate to contact [Monica Parodi](mailto:monica.parodi@nytimes.com), who oversees XFun recruiting, our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), or any of the PELs.

## Great! How do I find internal opportunities to consider?

Check the dedicated [Internal Greenhouse Job Board](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board). We also have slack channels [#tech-hiring](https://nytimes.slack.com/archives/CMJ4VQSGY) and [#engineering-opportunities](https://nytimes.slack.com/archives/C01CP6JEAPQ) where hiring managers will often post about internal-only opportunities.

If you don’t see a position currently listed:

-   **Ping [Monica Parodi](mailto:monica.parodi@nytimes.com) and let her know about your interest!**  She may know about roles about to be posted that could be a good fit, and can keep you in mind for future openings.
-   **If there are particular subject areas that you’d be interested in working in, don’t hesitate to contact the hiring manager for these groups** and schedule an informal chat.  These are valuable connections that can give you insight into how other groups work, and background on future opportunities.

## If I see an opportunity that’s interesting, what should I do next?

The first step is to have an informal, 20-30 minute conversation with the hiring manager.  The goal of this conversation is to give you a better understanding of the role, and the hiring manager an introduction to your background.  The hiring decision will not be made through this conversation.

Feel free to reach out directly to the hiring manager to schedule this conversation. The tech recruitment team can also help you figure out who to contact, and help you get an initial meeting set up. 

If the opportunity seems like it would be a good match for your interests, next you’ll need to let your current manager know before you submit your application in Workday.


## Looping in your current manager

You should let your current manager know about your interest in an internal mobility opportunity as soon as possible, to avoid any surprises and keep the lines of communication open.

You are not obligated to raise early, informal conversations with your current manager (and we ask hiring managers to keep these confidential.)

However, you must let your manager know about your interest when you submit your formal application in Workday. Your manager does not get a Workday alert when you apply for a role internally, but you must tell them when you submit your application.  This allows your manager to serve as an internal reference for you, keeps the line of communication open, and avoids any surprises throughout the process.  

A regular 1:1 conversation is a great place to raise this.  You might consider framing this as “I’m interested in finding out more about this opportunity…” or “I saw a role posted internally for X team, do you know anything about that team?” Additionally, you could share with your manager as you think about long term career planning, “As part of my learning plan I would like to learn more about X because I would like to pursue working more on X.”  

Once you’ve made your decision to apply, you can walk your manager through why you have decided to do so, which can range from expanding technical skills to wanting to get to know other teams in the organization.  

We expect your manager to be supportive of you in exploring this opportunity.  If you feel uncomfortable in any way in having this conversation, don’t hesitate to reach out to our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), or [Kate McCracken](mailto:kate.mccracken@nytimes.com) directly. They can provide direct support as well as coaching.

## How will my application be assessed?

You’ll be evaluated in different ways depending on how your current skillset maps to the skillset in the new role. If you have things that could be helpful, don’t be afraid to share those. There is a possibility that the hiring manager might ask you to do a technical screening, but this is not a requirement for this process, and is at the hiring manager’s discretion.

## I’ve talked with my manager, and have my application ready. How do I submit?

Contact the tech recruitment team, who will send you the correct Greenhouse link.  Note that you should always use the Greenhouse link that they share, rather than the external applicant page.

## What happens after I submit my application?

A member of the tech recruiting team will be in touch to help facilitate.

In most cases, you can expect to have a conversation with the hiring manager.  At the hiring manager’s discretion, additional interviews or technical assessment portions may be included.  

If you do not meet the minimum posted requirements for the position (seniority, skillset, etc.) or based on the status of the recruitment process, a hiring manager may decline to move forward with the interview.

Under Engineering Management Career Ladder guidelines, candidates for management roles can expect to meet with the [same minimum career ladder expectations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kM4W3sWP51jcZNHtoyO4s0jTzJ_k6p7BDO_Syz0VB-8/edit#heading=h.4epqnlxq9oxr) as external candidates.

When candidates are making a lateral move within the same skillset, we encourage hiring managers to lean heavily on the submitted portfolio instead of requiring a baseline technical assessment. Candidates may also supplement their portfolio with references from current teammates, but **this is not required**. For more details, reach out to our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com).

The primary recruiter for the role you’ve applied for will keep you updated on the decision-making timeline.  Keep in mind that there may be other candidates — internal and external — in the pipeline for the role, so a final decision on your application may take some time.

## How does my internal status factor into my application?

There is no hard requirement to prefer internal candidates, but we strongly encourage managers to offer opportunities wherever possible to support internal staffers’ long-term career goals.  Ultimately, the hiring manager is responsible for deciding which candidate is best for their team.

## How will the decision be communicated?

The hiring manager will schedule time with you to communicate the final decision.  If you have any questions about the status of your application, don’t hesitate to ping the tech recruiter as well as the hiring manager.

## How does the offer process work?

Your recruiter will facilitate the offer process.  For transfers on the individual contributor track, this is largely a formality since there are no title or compensation changes, but you do have to acknowledge the offer letter for the changes to take effect.

We expect that you will accept or decline in a timely manner.

## If I accept, how should I plan my transition?

You’ll work with both your current and new managers to set out a transition plan.

Plan on this transition taking roughly 1-4 weeks. You should expect to finish any outstanding work, write documentation and train your colleagues on your responsibilities. 

If any questions or frustrations arise during this process, don’t hesitate to ping our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), or [Kate McCracken](mailto:kate.mccracken@nytimes.com) directly.

## If I have questions, who should I contact?

[Monica Parodi](mailto:monica.parodi@nytimes.com) in Talent Acquisition is a great primary contact.  Don’t hesitate to reach out to our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com) or any of the PELs.
