# Manager’s Guide to Internal Mobility

**Important**
This builds on top of the main [Guide to Internal Mobility](/internal-mobility/) – please make sure you’ve reviewed this document first.

This document includes outlines responsibilities for both:

-   Hiring managers
-   Managers who have contributors transferring to another team

## Your role in encouraging internal mobility

As you check in on the career ambitions of your reports through 1:1s, mid-year, and year-end performance conversations, be sure to review internal mobility opportunities as it’s relevant and appropriate.  We hope to help every contributor find a long and rewarding career here at NYT; to do so your support and encouragement is critical.

## Guide for Hiring Managers

### Internal Recruiting

We should view transfers to another team through the internal mobility program as a positive outcome, and so there is no need to be hesitant about recruiting internally.  It isn’t “poaching” or “not being a team player.”

You should consider long-term recruiting strategies for internal candidates as well as external, including:

-   Getting to know engineers from other parts of the company who might have skills or experience relevant to your teams
-   Using org-wide events such as Maker Week to meet and develop relationships with other engineers

When you have an open position, you should:

-   Make sure that the role is posted in the [Internal Greenhouse Job Board](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board), with your contact information
-   Broadcast the position and a description of candidates you’re looking for in #tech-hiring and #eng-managers as appropriate
-   Work with recruiting to assemble a list of internal candidates interested in internal mobility that might be a good fit for the role

### Importance of confidentiality

To support candidates in career explorations, it’s important to consider an internal candidate’s interest to be confidential.  Only disclose details of your conversations on a need-to-know basis, unless the candidate allows otherwise.  When scheduling meetings, take care to make the meeting invite private to avoid broadcasting the candidate’s interest.

### Initial conversations with internal candidates

Internal candidates will be reaching out to you to schedule initial, informal meetings.  Please be responsive and schedule a meeting as soon as possible.

Use this session to:

-   Give the candidate some additional background on the role.
-   Answer any questions the candidate might have.
-   Learn a bit about the candidate’s background and experience.
-   Suggest current or former team members who can speak to how the team works day-to-day and its dynamics.
-   Communicate clear expectations about the interview and evaluation process to the candidate.

This session is not intended to be a decision-making or interview conversation, but rather an informational session.

### Interviews

To create transparency and fairness in the process, we should grant an interview to all qualified internal candidates wherever possible.

If an application clearly does not meet minimum seniority or skill requirements, or this would not be a good use of interviewers’ time given the state of the candidate pool, you can decline to interview the candidate — but must communicate this decision so there is no ambiguity.

We believe that candidates’ internal track records should be part of the evaluation process, and should take the place of formal tech screens. If it is helpful in your decision making, you may ask for a technical exercise with the candidate.

The interview process for internal candidates should include all stakeholders that would evaluate an external candidate.  For example: if product or design normally meets with external candidates, they should also meet with the internal candidate.

Additional interviews and evaluations can be added at your discretion. All parties involved should have a chance to offer feedback.

For management roles, the [same minimum career ladder expectations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kM4W3sWP51jcZNHtoyO4s0jTzJ_k6p7BDO_Syz0VB-8/edit#heading=h.4epqnlxq9oxr) apply to both internal and external candidates.

### Evaluating internal candidates

While there is no hard requirement to prefer internal candidates over external ones, we should aim to provide opportunities wherever possible towards internal candidates’ career development goals.

### Soliciting feedback

Before moving ahead with any offers, you are encouraged to discuss the transfer with the candidate’s current manager.  Only do so after you’ve confirmed with the candidate that they have let their current manager know about the transfer.  (By this point they should have, but best to avoid any surprises.)

The current manager cannot veto or stop the transfer, but they may have important feedback. They are also an important partner in ensuring a successful transition. In general, the current manager should be open and honest about the employee’s performance.  While this feedback will not include the physical copy of their last performance evaluation, the current manager can provide the performance rating and should paraphrase and summarize the evaluation overall, whether positive or negative.

### Candidate pool requirements

If the hiring panel offers positive feedback and you believe an internal candidate is the best way to proceed, you can make an offer without interviewing other candidates.  Use your judgment and fill the position taking into consideration your team’s needs and company diversity and inclusion values.

### Compensation

From a budget perspective, an internal transfer is no different than hiring an external candidate.  The recruiter can give you guidance on the candidate’s current compensation; you are responsible for making sure that you have sufficient budget to support an offer.  As with external hires, any requests to increase budget should go to the PEL in your reporting line.

Moves on the individual contributor track are lateral, and as a general rule are not coupled with a promotion or compensation changes.  If you believe that there is an extenuating circumstance, you should reach out to the PEL in your reporting line, our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), or [Kate McCracken](mailto:kate.mccracken@nytimes.com) directly. These conversations should conclude before an offer is formally extended.

### Communicating the decision

Take care to inform the candidate about your decision in a timely manner.  It’s particularly important that internal candidates have a positive experience when receiving the final decision.  If you need help, coaching, or a practice run, don’t hesitate to reach out to our [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com) or [Kate McCracken](mailto:kate.mccracken@nytimes.com) directly

If you are declining the candidate, offer constructive feedback on what sorts of skills and experience would help the candidate have a stronger application in the future.

### Transition

Talk with the candidate and their current manager to work out a reasonable timeline for the transfer. The current manager has the authority to set this timeline, with an understanding that the transfer should be completed as soon as possible.  Plan on this transition period taking 1-4 weeks.

Work with your recruiter or department administrator for any transition process.

### Welcome and onboarding

You should take care to provide internal transfers with the same welcome and onboarding experience you would for an external hire.  Plan to send a welcome note to [product.engineering@nytimes.com](mailto:product.engineering@nytimes.com) and the relevant mission email list, and offer the employee any onboarding or training that you normally offer to external hires.

## Guide for Current Managers

### When a member of a team is interested in internal mobility

We expect you to be supportive. While concerns may immediately come to mind such as team workload, worries about the backfill, or personal feelings about the move, we expect you to put the emphasis in this moment on supporting the individual in their long-term career objectives.

If you have specific concerns about a direct report’s interest in a transfer and how this transfer may impact your group’s work, discuss this with your manager or the PEL in your reporting line

### Providing feedback to the hiring manager

The hiring manager will reach out to you as part of the evaluation process.  Serve as a reference for your employee, and be honest.  You should also feel free to contact the hiring manager at any time, once your report has let you know about their interest in the role.

While you should not share copies of performance reviews during the evaluation process, remember that if the transfer moves ahead the new manager will have access to all prior review documents.  You should make sure that your feedback accurately reflects the content of these reviews.

### When an offer is made and accepted

Email [Monica Parodi](mailto:monica.parodi@nytimes.com), [Engineering HRBP Team](mailto:techhrbpteam@nytimes.com), and [Sue Kim (Finance)](mailto:kims@nytimes.com) with details about how you plan to backfill the vacant position.

### Transitioning the employee

Talk to the employee and their new manager to set up a reasonable transition plan. You should aim to complete the transfer as quickly as possible, but it is your responsibility to ensure that all work is completed and knowledge is transferred to other members of the team. You have the final say on this timeline, but it should generally take 1-4 weeks.  

You should work to ensure that the employee does not take old responsibilities with them when they transfer to a new team. Although some level of informal support might follow the employee in the short term, the goal should be to remove that from their plate as soon as possible.
