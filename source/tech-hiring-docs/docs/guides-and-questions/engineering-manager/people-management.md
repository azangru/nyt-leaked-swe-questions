## Introductions
Each Interviewer: Hi, my name is {name}. I’m a {role} on {team}, my pronouns are {pronouns} and I’ve been at The Times for {time}. [describe what your team does for The New York Times and your role].
Today, we want to learn a little about your experiences with People Management and working on teams with different types of people. At the Times, we treat management as a separate career growth track from independent contributors, so this is an important part of our interview process.

### Questions

### How is your team currently structured?

Depending on how they answer, you can follow up with any details you might need to continue the interview.  understanding this context will set up subsequent relevant questions.
* How many reports the candidate has?
* Whether there are cross-functional product/project/design partners?
* Who are their peer teams?
* How many people report to the candidate’s manager?
* The kind of work that the team takes up (backend/infrastructure vs user-facing, etc), dependent teams


### If the role is managing engineers

Tell me about an engineer that you identified a growth opportunity or stretch goal for. How did you prepare that engineer to be successful? What did the engineer learn?

* Good answers: Specific engineer, specific goals, preparation of the engineer, clear outcomes, possible promotion
* Poor answers: High level, abstract, driven more by the engineer than the manager, no example

Tell me about a time when you had to manage an engineer who was underperforming. What was the nature of the issue? What kind of feedback did you give? What was the outcome?

* Good answers: References a specific engineer. Can frame a feedback discussion. Brings in HR as appropriate. Can point to a career ladder or other rubric as a means of setting performance expectations. Bonus points for referencing a performance issue that is not a problem with writing code.
* Poor answers: Vague, high level, hypothetical, no clear outcomes or expectations set

Tell me how you think about hiring -- if we can stipulate that the person is technically competent, what other qualities do you look for when someone joins your team? How can you tell when the person displays those qualities?

* Good answers: Growth mindset, empathy, collaboration, team player, mentor, levels up others, lack of ego, willingness to teach and learn. Specific examples of how these qualities are demonstrated either through questions or, for example, behavior during a pair programming interview. Brings up D&I unprompted.
* Poor answers: Exclusively focused on coding, behavioral qualities generic and high level, inexperience with interviewing and hiring.


### If the role is managing managers

Tell me about a manager that you identified a stretch goal for, or an individual contributor that you grew into management. How did you prepare the manager to be successful? What did the manager learn?

* Good answers: Specific manager, specific goals, clear outcomes/deliverables, possible promotion (or recognition that the engineer was not interested in management after all and returned to the IC track -- that’s also a success)
* Poor answers: Vague, high level, don’t refer to a specific incident even after redirection

How do you measure the performance of the managers in your organization? Have you ever had to give feedback to a manager who was underperforming? What was the outcome?

* Good answers: Skip level meetings, surveys, psychological safety, delivery of code in the context of other data. Feedback is clear, specific and actionable. Brings in HR as appropriate. Has a clear rubric for success. 
* Poor answers: uses one tool to evaluate performance to the exclusion of all others (for example, only shipping code, only references skip level meetings). Has never given challenging feedback, or gave challenging feedback without clear outcomes. Vague, high level, abstract, confusing answer.

Tell me how you think about hiring managers. What are the qualities you look for? How can you tell when someone displays those qualities?

* Good answers: Growth mindset, empathy, collaboration, team player, mentor, levels up others, lack of ego, willingness to teach and learn. Specific examples.
* Poor answers: Vague, high level, exclusively delivery focused.


### All Candidates

Tell me about a time when you needed to manage a conflict between people on your team(s). What happened, and how was it resolved?

* Good answers: The manager did something to resolve the conflict, whether it was having people with a technical disagreement write RFCs to explain their thinking, personally mediating a disagreement, bringing in HR if necessary, “disagree and commit” with measurable outcomes/plan to circle back to the decision, etc.
* Poor answers: Inaction, “they just worked it out”, “we moved on”, vague, abstract, “there’s never been a conflict”.

Tell me how you think about team culture. What is your role in creating culture on your team?

* Good answers: Talks about recognition, psychological safety, clarity of expectations, communication, fun/team bonding
* Poor answers: Vague, high level, abstract

What are the pros and cons of remote work? Do you have any specific strategies to help your remote employees succeed?

* Good answers: Additional overhead of asynchronous communication and the necessity of refining process to support remote work. Necessity of documentation. Managing meetings so remote employees can see and hear. Has an opinion on time zone overlap. Can talk about when and where in-person face time is critical for the team. Possibly references D&I/hiring benefits. Can talk about impact to the overall team culture. Understands the difference between a fully distributed team and a mixed distributed/in-person team. May reference challenges in pay equity, taxes in different parts of the world, etc.
* Poor answers: Either a blanket, unspecific “remote work is great” or “I don’t do remote”. Answers exclusively focus on tools such as Slack and Zoom. Lack of specificity and nuance.

Tell me how you think about diversity and inclusion. 

* Good answers: Specific, actionable. Could reference hiring practices to make all candidates feel more comfortable, personal sourcing from underrepresented communities such as bootcamps or targeted Meetups, ERGs, pay equity, analytics to make sure promotion rates are comparable, networking with senior underrepresented people, psychological safety, surveys, exit interviews.
* Poor answers: “I don’t see color”, “It’s a pipeline problem”, “Tech is a meritocracy”, “This issue is overblown”, clearly racist or sexist answers (it happens), solely targeting junior hires, discussion of recruiting but no thought/answer to inclusion efforts once someone has joined.
