* Overview of team (5 min)
* Your questions (20-35 min) 
* Their questions (5-10 min)

## Questions:
* Talk to me about how your team is currently structured [depending on how they answer, you can follow up with any details you might need to continue the interview: how many reports the candidate has, whether there are cross-functional product/project/design partners, who are their peer teams, how many people report into the candidate’s manager, the kind of work that the team takes up (backend/infrastructure vs user facing, etc), dependent teams] -- understanding this context will set up subsequent relevant questions.
* Have you ever had to manage through an organizational change, a difficult business environment, or layoffs? Was this change initiated by you, or communicated by you? If initiated by the candidate, follow up by asking for details regarding how they thought about it (on the single team level, this could be moving people into different squads, etc., on the Director+ level this could be a reorg; Layoffs could apply to either). If not initiated by the candidate, how did they communicate the change? 
    * Good answers: Thought put into how the team was structured, if they had control over that (clear goals and measurable outcomes). Concern with psychological safety, to the extent that they could control that. Frank discussion of subsequent turnover. 
    * Poor answers: No experience, no empathy for people with less control in the situation, no clear outcomes/deliverables
* What is the mission or purpose of your company? Tell me about how you connect the mission or purpose of the company to the day to day work of your engineers. 
    * Good answers: Clear answer on mission/purpose/values (every company should have these, regardless of industry, I hope). An explanation of how they think about meaning/purpose in work, even for engineers whose work would seem to be unrelated.
    * Poor answers: Uncertain about mission/purpose/values. Can’t create a picture of clear outcomes or purpose. Never thought about it.
* Tell me about how you think about the health of a team. What specifically do you look for to determine whether or not a team is functioning well?
    * Good answers: Positive survey results, psychological safety, regular delivery in the context of other factors, retention/low turnover, diversity & inclusion answers
    * Poor answers: Focused exclusively on code, abstract/high level
* Tell me about a time when you had an impact on the overall engineering culture of your organization (looking for cross-org initiatives such as: hiring, career ladder development, diversity/inclusion/ERGs, cultural work such as book clubs or training initiatives, bringing in Meetups to the organization).
    * Good answers: Specific, ready answer, excited to talk about this
    * Poor answers: Can’t identify a specific cross-org initiative, doesn’t see why this is important, abstract/high-level or checked out response
* Tell me about a time when you needed to give bad news to a stakeholder (could be: late project, employee resigning, failed initiative, etc.)
    * Good answers: Specific, honest, transparent, aware of lessons learned
    * Poor answers: Evasive, blames others
* Tell me about how work comes into your team. How is the product roadmap developed? What is your role?
    * Good answers: Brings up tech debt unprompted. Has clear ideas about their product; clearly sees themselves as a partner to product management. Can reference the tech debt/feature work negotiation. May bring up dependency management. May talk about OKR development. Could reference analytics, A/B testing, or other success metrics.
    * Poor answers: Engineers are ticket takers, do what product tells them, do what clients tell them. 
* Tell me about a time when someone changed your mind.
    * Good answers: Thoughtful, possibly funny, self-aware, can explain initial position, subsequent position and what changed.
    * Poor answers: Not specific, even with prompting. Can’t think of an example.
