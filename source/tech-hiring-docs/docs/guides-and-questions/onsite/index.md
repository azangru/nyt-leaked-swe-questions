## Structure

The onsite interview is divided into evaluations of [algorithms and data structures](algo-and-data-structures/), [system design](systems-design/) and [non-technical skills](non-technical/). Each section includes guidance on what to ask and a rubric for how to evaluate the candidate's responses.
