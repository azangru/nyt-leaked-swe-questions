See the
[coding question guide](coding-interview.md)
for more information about conducting an Algorithms & Data Structures interview.

Be sure to be familiar with at least two Algorithms & Data Structures questions,
in case the candidate is already familiar with a question or finishes very
quickly. These questions are not language-specific, and should be appropriate
for any language.
