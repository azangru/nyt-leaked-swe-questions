# Manager Interview

For this interview slot we intentionally do not provide sample questions nor a rubric. We want to leave it up to the discretion of the hiring manager to ask the questions that they deem relevant. It is an opportunity for the manager to evaluate if the candidate would be a good fit for their team and / or the position.

It is also an opportunity for us to **sell** the position to the candidate. An interview is an opportunity for us to select the right candidate, but it is also an opportunity for the candidates to pick the right employer.

## Interview format

We suggest to have this portion of the interview to be 50 / 50. 

* half the time for the manager to ask a few questions
* half the time for the candidate to ask questions, this is the time to **sell NYT**

## What this interview is not

* it is not a place to pitch your team (T&I can always set up follow-up phone calls after the interview for this specific purpose)
* it is not a replacement for any of the other interviews (algorithm, system design, value aligment, ...)

## Selling points for NYT

* The New York Times mission. We seek the truth and help people understand the world
* Even though we're over 100 years old, we are a growing, tech-driven company
* A company that really cares about their employees and cares about work-life balance
* Solving challenging technological problems ... you can tailor this one to your team
* A culture where people are generally friendly and always willing to help and collaborate
* Autonomy for teams and individual engineers to creatively solve problems
* Emphasis on learning: tuition reimbursement, attend 2 conferences, maker week, onsite talks and workshops
* Wildcard. In the beginning of the interview, when you ask them questions, pick up on what they value, and then try to incorporate that into your answers.
