# Values alignment

## Introductions

Each Interviewer: Hi, my name is {name}. I’m a {role} on {team}, my pronouns are {pronouns} and I’ve been at The Times for {time}.
[describe what your team does for The New York Times and your role].

Please let me or other interviewers know if you need anything throughout the interviews. If you can't hear or don't understand the questions, please ask us to repeat and we will repeat the question or ask it in a different way. If you need anything after this interview, don't hesitate to ask your coordinator or recruiter as well.

Today, we want to understand more about your philosophies and values as a
Software Engineer. We have a couple of questions for you that will help us learn
more about challenges you’ve faced in your career and how you work in different
situations.

## Build Trust

-   Have you ever had to introduce a policy or procedure change to your work
    group? How did you do it?
-   Have you ever met with resistance when putting into effect a new idea or
    policy to a work group? How did you deal with it? What happened?
-   Describe a situation in which you had to remain flexible and open-minded in
    order to succeed at something.
-   Trust requires personal accountability. Can you tell about a time when you
    chose to trust someone? What was the outcome?

## Do hard things

Tell me about a time you had to surmount an obstacle to reach a goal. What was
the problem, and what did you do about it?

## Instigate change

During a meeting, how do you create a productive atmosphere and reduce those
factors that interfere or inhibit productivity?

Can you give me an example of a time you had to pitch an implementation strategy
or new idea to a group of your co-workers? How did you do? Why do you think
things went that way?

Get the candidate excited to talk about the great teams they've been a part of.
If the candidate talks about how the strategy wasn't accepted or agreed upon by
the group, really dig into why they believe that is.

Red flags:

-   Do they talk negatively about the group being useless?
-   Do they believe they rode in and saved the day with their implementation
    strategy and how they felt they were the smartest one in the group?
-   If the strategy wasn't implemented and it turned out it would have saved
    their project, how did they feel about that? Do they believe the team failed
    and they succeeded?

Great things to look out for:

-   Do they mention the good probing questions of their teammates?
-   Are they framing this story as one where they took the initiative to work
    together on a problem (as opposed to trying to be the smartest person in the
    room)?
-   Are they mentioning what that experience taught them? (If not, ask them!)

How do you feel about having to change direction in the middle of an activity?

## Level up

Describe a time when you had to complete a task you’d never done before. How did
you start?

It's not uncommon that we've had to take on extra responsibilities for a short
amount of time, or perhaps longer. Look for examples of how the candidate
handled when it was their opportunity to do something new in their role.

-   Were they willing? Did they enjoy it or perhaps see it as a growth
    opportunity?
-   Did they refuse it or perhaps delegate/pass the buck?
-   How did they get started?
-   What did they learn afterwards?

## Time is precious

Describe a time you’ve had to make a difficult trade-off.

Looking for:

-   Able to prioritize competing needs effectively
-   Able to balance ideology with pragmatism

Not looking for:

-   Sacrificing quality for the sake of moving fast

## Have fun

What’s the most fun part of your job, a previous job, a future job (i.e., this
one)?

Looking for:

-   Deriving immense pleasure from their work
-   Optimistic about opportunities

Not looking for:

-   Pessimistic and unable to describe highlights of previous roles
-   Doesn’t show interest in learning from colleagues
-   Sees work as clock-in/clock-out
-   Negativity about the business or product
