# Ability to Learn & Teach

_Note that the interview script and questions have been bolded for clarity._

## Introductions

Each Interviewer: **Hi, my name is {name}. I’m a {role} on {team}, my pronouns
are {pronouns} and I’ve been at The Times for {time}. [describe what your team
does for The New York Times and your role].**

**Please let me or other interviewers know if you need anything throughout the
interviews. If you can't hear or don't understand the questions, please ask us
to repeat and we will repeat the question or ask it in a different way. If you
need anything after this interview, don't hesitate to ask your coordinator or
recruiter as well.**

**Today, we want to learn a little about your experiences of learning new things
and working on teams with different types of people. At the Times, we put a big
emphasis on learning and development in tech, so this is an important part of
our interview process.**

## Curiosity

**How do you go about learning new things?**

Looking for:

-   Self-directed learning
-   Feeling the need to figure out why something was broken, deriving
    satisfaction from finding answers
-   Evidence of self-improvement

Not looking for:

-   No interest in tech or journalism
-   Accepting things at face value

## (Self-)Awareness

**Have you ever had to confess or admit to a mistake in the workplace?**

Discuss the situation.

**Can you share a particular experience in which you felt you were too
persistent? What happened? How could you have improved the outcome?**

**Can you tell me about a time you received critical feedback?**

Looking for:

-   Integrating feedback to improve
-   Reflective statements: “I was immature,” “I wasn’t willing to compromise”
-   Having made deliberate career choices in response to past experiences

Not looking for:

-   No interest in receiving feedback
-   False-modesty: “Sometimes I work too hard.”

## Empathy

**Tell me about a time where you weren't getting along with someone you were
working with. How did you work to resolve that?**

If the candidate answers how they've always gotten along with everyone they've
worked with, ask them to **describe a situation where they've needed something
from someone they weren't getting along with**. If that doesn't draw an
examples, ask them generally **how they approach conflict resolution. What are
some techniques they employ?**

-   When in conflict, are they assuming positive intent from the other person?
-   When talking about this person, are they focusing on behaviors (e.g. "John
    would frequently interrupt me in our team meetings.") or are they focusing
    on the person (e.g. "John is self-centered and a terrible human being.")
-   As they're describing the conflict, are they showing empathy for the other
    person or their past self for mistakes that were made? (e.g. "John's
    constant interruptions would set me off. I didn't react well when it
    happened and would interrupt him back. I'd later learn he was under intense
    pressure to get home on time to see his children before bed and wanted to
    cut to the chase. His behavior was unacceptable, and maybe mine too, but
    knowing this fact about him helped me see our issue had nothing to do with
    me personally.")
-   Was the conflict resolved? How? If not, what do they believe could have
    been?

**Have you ever worked with someone who was struggling in their role?**

This question looks for both empathy and leadership potential in the candidate.
Things to look out for when they tell their story:

-   Were they too quick to judge without asking questions?
-   What was their approach to this issue?
    -   Did they discipline or complain to their manager about the struggling
        teammate?
    -   Did they see a leadership opportunity to mentor someone and proactively
        help them?
    -   Did they do nothing? (If so, was it because they didn't feel technical
        enough? What happened as a result?)

## Communication

**Have you ever had to get a point across to different types of people? What
approach did you take?**

Looking for:

-   Gauge how the candidate approaches the varying audiences in a discussion.
    Chances are very likely that an engineer has to speak to a group consisting
    of other engineers, product owners, project managers, and various other
    non-technical roles.
-   Additional questions you can build on:
    -   Ask them to go deep on a specific instance where they were working with
        their project manager or product owner.
    -   Ask them to describe interactions with people who communicate
        differently from them. How have they worked with people quieter or
        louder?
    -   Have they worked with international colleagues where English is not
        their first language? What measures do they take to ensure people of
        different backgrounds aren't lost in slang or cultural references?

**Give me an example of how you've explained a complicated engineering problem
to someone who was new to the team or new to the situation.**

Looking for:

-   Similar to the above question, but this version is more focused on how they
    communicate to their peers who are either not as technical as they are or
    perhaps being brought in cold to a stream of work or project unfamiliar to
    them.

**Can you pick something that you really enjoy or like to do and teach it to me?
Assume I know absolutely nothing and walk me through it. It can be anything, it
doesn't have to be tech related but feel free to pick something about tech if
you want.**

Looking for:

-   Gauge how the candidate walks you through the topic. Check your assumptions!
    Remember you are John Snow, you know nothing. Ask questions throughout their
    lesson, especially on steps or concepts that may seem obvious but not
    explicitly stated.
-   Assess how they build on concepts, layer information and whether or not they
    are able to give clear instructions.
-   Check if the candidate answers follow up questions in detail and recalibrate
    to give more context with the rest of their lesson.

## Collaboration

**Have you ever had an experience in which you failed to see an idea gain
cooperation the first time, but succeeded later?  What was the difference?**

**How would you respond to a co-worker who suggests an idea that you know won’t
work?**

Something to look out for here is if the candidate feels that he or she only
holds the right answers. It's perfectly acceptable and normal to disagree. See
how they handle the disagreement:

-   Do they get curious? "Hmm. I tried X but it didn't work for me. How did it
    work for you?"
-   Do they collaborate? A great response is if the candidate tries to reframe
    problems from "let's see if I'm right or you're right" to "can we try to
    figure out the truth together?"
-   Do they ask about the other person's experience?
    -   Given statement X. "Is X true? I understood X to mean something else."
        as opposed to "No, X is wrong. It doesn't do that. Well it didn't when I
        did X so maybe you're doing something weird."

## Perspective

**How do you approach working with another person or team internally or
externally?** **Describe a situation in which you put in extra effort to build a
relationship with an internal or external customer.**

Looking for:

-   An interest in others’ points of view
-   Value in diverse perspectives

**The New York Times values diversity from our journalism to our employment practices. 
Many companies state this as a core value, but it can take different forms in different environments. 
What does an organization or team that values diversity look like to you?**

Looking for:

-   Demonstrates a desire to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment, whether in their immediate team or organization-wide.
-   Expresses empathy for colleagues from diverse backgrounds and experiences, even if they are not able to suggest policies or cite concrete examples.

## Conclusion

Interviewer: **Thanks so much for your time today. We’ve left a couple minutes
to answer your questions. Do you have any questions for us?**

[please refer to your calendar invite for interview panel email to note what is
next on the candidate’s agenda, in case you need to walk them to the elevator or
to a different room. If you are the last interviewer, please walk them to the
elevator and let them know that their recruiter will be in touch with next
steps]
