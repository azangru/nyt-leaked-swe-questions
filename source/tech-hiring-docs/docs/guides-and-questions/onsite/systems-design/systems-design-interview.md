## I. Introduction (5 mins)

!!! quote
    “Hi {candidate}. I’m {interviewer}, and this is {interviewer}. Thanks for taking
    the time to meet with us today. We’re both excited to get to know you and your
    work better.

!!! quote
    “First we’ll both tell you a bit more about ourselves. I’m a {role} on {team}, my pronouns are {pronouns}
    and I’ve been at The Times for {time}.”

Allow the other interviewer to introduce themselves.

!!! quote
    “Please let me or other interviewers know if you need anything throughout the interviews. If you can't hear or don't understand the questions, please ask us to repeat and we will repeat the question or ask it in a different way. If you need anything after this interview, don't hesitate to ask your coordinator or recruiter as well.”

!!! quote
    “Our role today is to assess your experience and skills in application design.
    We’re going to spend about 45 minutes asking you design a
    theoretical application, and we’ll save some time at the end for your questions.
    Do you have any questions before we get started?”


## II. Design of a theoretical system (40 mins)

!!! quote
    “Let’s get started. Take a moment to review this description and
    these requirements.”

!!! note
    If the interview is being done remotely, you should paste the requirements in a shareable CoderPad, Google Doc or Google Draw. For actual diagramming, we recommend Google Draw for diagraming, but you can also have the candidate screenshare and use a diagramming software of their preference.

[Choose the appropriate theoretical system from the question bank](index.md).

When you’ve finished describing the system...

!!! quote
    “Do you have any questions for
    us before you get started?”

    “Okay great. We’d like you to use the whiteboard to sketch your thoughts. And
    please feel free to ask any questions that might come up.”

## IV. Candidate Questions (5 mins)

!!! quote
    “We want to make sure we leave some time for your questions, so we’ll wrap up
    with our portion of the interview and turn it over to you. Are there any
    questions you have for us about tech at The Times?”

Answer questions, then wrap up.
