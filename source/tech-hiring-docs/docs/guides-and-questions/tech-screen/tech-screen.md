## Overview

The purpose of the Google Hangouts interview is to assess whether a candidate is
likely to succeed in the in-person interview. At this early phase in the hiring
process we’re looking for hard no’s and soft yes’s: A candidate can move forward
without strong positives as long as they don't have strong negatives. The
interviewer’s goal should be to get a sense for the candidate’s skills and
qualities in the technical and non-technical areas listed below.

## Assessment criteria

Candidates are assessed using Medium’s engineering interview rubric, with a
focus on the criteria under Ability to Build Software and Ability to Learn and
Teach (See the
[Full Tech Screen Rubric](tech-assessment-rubric.md) and the [Ability to Learn and Teach Rubric](../onsite/non-technical/learn-and-teach-rubric.md) for more
information).

### Non-technical

-   **Resoluteness**: Describes persevering through a difficult situation and
    achieving a good outcome; describes prior challenges as growth opportunities
-   **Curiosity**: Asks insightful questions about the role or company;
    describes or demonstrates a desire to figure out why something was broken,
    and derives satisfaction from finding answers
-   **Self-Awareness**: Indicates they have thought about how they can improve
-   **Empathy**: Demonstrates that they recognize the impact of their actions on
    colleagues, and understands that their perspective is not the only valid one
-   **Communication**: Talks at a level appropriate to their audience when
    explaining something
-   **Collaboration**: Employs a collaborative approach to
    problem solving, soliciting perspective and feedback from others, and
    integrating this into their solution
-   **Perspective**: Able to describe the needs of a new demographic audience;
    recognizes the value of diverse perspectives

### Technical

-   **Problem solving**: Asks questions to clarify the scope of the problem and
    states their assumptions
-   **Code fluency**: May use placeholders to abstract away functionality then
    fill them in later
-   **Autonomy**: Makes decisions without seeking approval but describes the
    rationale to the interviewer
-   **Basic Computer Science Knowledge**: Can articulate why a specific data
    structure is appropriate
-   **Resoluteness**: Demonstrates a desire to finish the assigned task;
    suitably motivated to fix issues
-   **Communication**: Describes how their code works, unprompted

## Interview Script

The phone interview should take up to 60 minutes but can run over by 5 minutes. Interviewers should plan to spend about 30 minutes on some background questions. The second 30 minute-portion should be spent on a shared coding exercise.

-   Introduction (5m)
-   [Background questions (25m)](./background-questions.md)
-   Brief coding exercise (25m)
-   Candidate’s questions (5m)

### Phone Interview Script/Questions

!!! tip
    Make sure to get access to CoderPad before your interview! If you haven't
    used CoderPad before, you can request access [through Bytes](https://nytimes.service-now.com/bytes?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=bec5c20bdb85dc10e8a379531f9619b2).

Some things to have prepared before calling the candidate:

-   Secure a room or quiet place to conduct the interview
-   Login to CoderPad from [access.nyt.net](https://access.nyt.net).
-   Create a “Pad” in CoderPad for the interview and label it with the
    candidate’s name. **To avoid the candidate seeing questions beforehand,
    don’t send the shareable link to the candidate till it’s time for the coding
    exercise.**
-   Print out a copy of their resume
-   Pull up any relevant project links in their resume
-   If the candidate provided a Github profile, dig through some of their code

### Introduction

Once the candidate is on the Google Hangout, confirm it's them you're speaking
to and make sure they’re ready for the interview. This is a good opportunity for
you, the interviewer, to set a relaxed tone before you jump into any questions.
Share a little bit about who you are, what your role is, and how your day is
going to remind them there's a human interviewing them.

**You:** Hi! Good afternoon. Is this Janice I am speaking with?

**Candidate:** Yes, this is Janice! Hi!

**You:** Hi, Janice. This is Taylor from the The New York Times. How are you today?

**Candidate:** Hi, Taylor! I'm doing well. How are you?

**You:** Great thanks. Is this still a good time for us to speak?

**Candidate:** Yes it is.

**You:** We’ll have at least 25 minutes together to discuss your background,
technical work, and some technical questions. This will be followed by a 25
minute coding exercise we can work through together. Sound good?

**Candidate:** Yep, sounds great.

### Background

**You:** Let me quickly give you some background on myself.  I’m a {role} on {team}, my pronouns are {pronouns} and I’ve been at The Times for {time}. (Briefly explain
your role and your team’s work.) 

Please let me or other interviewers know if you need anything throughout the interviews. If you can't hear or don't understand the questions, please ask us to repeat and we will repeat the question or ask it in a different way. If you need anything after this interview, don't hesitate to ask your coordinator or recruiter as well.

Now I’d like to hear your story, if you could share a bit about who you are and what interests you in this role at NYT?

### Background questions

**You:** We would like to dive more into your experience by asking you about an application you’ve worked on.
We can discuss any application but typically what you’re working on works best.

Then use the [background questions](./background-questions.md) for further discussion.

### Brief Coding Exercise

Use CoderPad for the coding portion of the interview. Many of the questions are
pre-loaded into the website.

**You:** We’ll spend about 25 minutes on this, and I’ll let you know when we
have about a few minutes left.
([See the coding exercise](remove-dupes.md)).

**Candidate:** Sounds great, I’m ready. **You:** Here’s the exercise. [Introduce
the problem] Feel free to work in whatever language you’re most comfortable in.
Also, don’t worry if the syntax isn’t perfect. If you want to start with
pseudocode that’s fine too.

Some useful things to look for:

-   Does the candidate ask questions about the expectations of the problem?
-   Can the candidate proactively identify edge cases and things to test?
-   Can the candidate spot their own bugs?
-   Can the candidate identify a brute force solution and proactively push for a
    better one?
-   Does the candidate verify their code and approach, or do they jump into
    coding and then call it done?

Some prompts:

-   Any downsides to that approach?
-   Are there any improvements you might want to make?
-   Are there any (other) data structures that might be helpful?

### Questions from the Candidate (5 minutes)

-   Those are all the questions I have for you. We have a few minutes left for
    any questions you might have about the role, working in technology at The
    Times, or anything else.
-   If a candidate has specific questions about what teams they are being
    considered for, you can let them know that they can check with their
    recruiter on this, and that we will be making that clear to them before the
    next round of interviews.

### Closing

Thank them for their time. Let them know that the recruiter they've been talking
to will be reaching out shortly with next steps. Let them know there [will|may]
be more time to ask questions that didn’t come to mind during the phone screen.

### Submitting feedback

Feedback should be submitted right after the interview and before discussing the
interview with anyone. Your recruiter will email you a Google Form to provide
feedback with.
