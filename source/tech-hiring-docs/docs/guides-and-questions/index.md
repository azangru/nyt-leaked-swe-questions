# Interview Question Banks and Guides

The question banks are the home for approved interview questions for technical
interviews across all processes (e.g. frontend, backend, etc.) and supported
programming languages. The guides provided are a template to follow for each
phase of the interview process.

## Goals of the Question Bank & Guides

-   Give incoming candidates the best possible interview experience
-   Empower interviewers to most effectively and fairly assess incoming
    candidates.
-   Allow hiring managers to gather the information they need to make the best
    hires.

## Question Bank Organization

The question bank is broken up into guides and questions. Read the
guide first, and then familiarize yourself with the
technical questions.
