*This list of principles that have guided decisions that the Tech Hiring working group has made while creating and updating the Tech Hiring process. Suggestions for changes should adhere to these changes. In addition, this is itself a living document and anyone can suggest changes to the principles we use for hiring.*

- We wish to have a standardized and consistent process
    - By using general evergreen job postings to create candidate pools for 
    general roles
    - To make it easier to transfer internally
- We consider candidates for multiple roles without having them go through the 
process multiple times
- We provide flexibility for teams with specialized needs to modify the
questions asked to evaluate candidates based on their needs. 
- We hope to have a diverse candidate pool that is treated without bias
    - By providing a central view of the pipeline to help measure diversity
    - By employing diverse interview panels and use rubrics to assess 
    candidates
- We distribute and share interview responsibilities across engineering teams
- We should move candidates quickly through our process
    - By administering remote tech assessments over take home tests
    - By holding debriefs ASAP after panel interviews 
- There should be (tech + recruiting) community ownership over documentation
    - The techdocs site is a compromise since not all people have access to 
    GitHub, but it enables a good process to propose and review changes 
- Principles for Question design are in the [contributing guide](https://hiring.tech.nyt.net/contributing/#adding-new-questions):
    - Difficulty: A question should be able to scale in difficulty. The goal 
    is to have different expectations for varied experience levels, outlined 
    in the leveling notes.
    - Clarity: Any interviewee with a technical background should be able to
    clearly understand the question. More written clarifications and examples
    are better so interviewers don't have to come up with them on the spot. 
    There should also be instructions for the interviewer especially for what
    may be good follow up questions.
    - Relevance: The question should examine knowledge/skills required in the
    day-to-day performance of one's job duties. It should not depend on knowing
    any special tricks or having obscure knowledge not required to do the job.
    - Not findable online: We should aim for questions that are not a 'typical'
    interview question found in books or online. We should also aim to have 
    enough variety that questions won't end up on Glassdoor.
