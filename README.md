## Description

In summer 2024, there was a [story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40609922) that a truckload of code from the New York Times repositories was leaked.

I got curious whether the leak contained any questions or test assignments for candidates for software developer roles. By inspecting the [list](https://files.catbox.moe/jx7ksm.txt) of leaked repos, I checked out the ones with suggestive names, and collected them here. I was only interested in web development roles; and discarded repos whose names suggested that they were targeting mobile developers, or other software development roles.

The original materials are copied into the `source` directory. Each top-level directory inside of the `source` directory was originally its own repository. I am removing git history from all of them.

## Last commit dates of source directories
Since I am removing git history from the source directories, I wanted to record when they were last updated. The only recent one is `tech-hiring-docs`; others are from 2020 and earlier.
